# Product Requirements Document: LangChain and LangGraph Integration

## Overview

The Nflow AI Assistant API currently uses a custom-built multi-agent system that requires manual management of memory, tool calls, and agent coordination. This feature aims to refactor the existing implementation to leverage LangChain.js and LangGraph.js, industry-standard frameworks for building multi-agent systems, resulting in a more maintainable, extensible, and robust agent architecture.

## Background

The current multi-agent architecture has the following components:

- Coordinator Agent: Orchestrates the workflow between agents
- Intent Agent: Determines user intent and creates task plans
- Classifier Agent: Classifies message types
- Application/Object/Layout/Flow Agents: Domain-specific agents that generate resources
- Executor Agent: Handles the execution of agent outputs

While functional, this approach requires significant custom code to manage state, handle errors, and coordinate between agents. It also lacks advanced features like persistence, human-in-the-loop workflows, and proper memory management that come built-in with LangGraph.

## Goals

1. Simplify agent implementation by leveraging LangGraph's graph-based workflow system
2. Improve reliability and maintainability of the multi-agent system
3. Standardize the approach to building and connecting agents
4. Enable advanced features like:
   - Persistence and resumability of agent workflows
   - Better human-in-the-loop interactions
   - Improved error handling and recovery
   - Enhanced debugging capabilities
5. Reduce custom code needed for agent coordination and memory management
6. Maintain all existing agent functionality during the migration

## Non-Goals

1. Changing the core functionality of individual agents
2. Modifying the Nflow API integration layer
3. Altering the user experience or chat interface

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Graph-Based Agent Workflow:**

   - Define agent interactions using LangGraph's graph-based approach
   - Maintain the same logical flow of the current architecture
   - Support conditional branching and cycles where needed

2. **Agent Implementation:**

   - Refactor each agent (Coordinator, Intent, Application, Object, Layout, Flow, Executor) to use LangChain/LangGraph patterns
   - Adapt existing agent prompts and contexts for use with LangChain
   - Implement proper state management for each agent

3. **Tool Integration:**

   - Convert existing tool definitions to LangChain's tool format
   - Maintain the same tool functionality for Nflow API interactions
   - Support streaming of tool execution events

4. **Memory and Context Management:**

   - Implement short and long-term memory using LangChain's memory models
   - Maintain conversational history and context between agent calls
   - Support retrieval of relevant information from past interactions

5. **Human-in-the-Loop Integration:**

   - Support interruption of agent workflows for human approval
   - Allow continuation of workflows after human intervention
   - Preserve context during interruption and resumption

6. **Persistence:**
   - Save agent state between interactions
   - Support resuming agent workflows
   - Enable tracing and replay of agent decisions

### Technical Requirements

1. **Framework Integration:**

   - Integrate LangChain.js and LangGraph.js libraries with the existing NestJS application
   - Ensure compatibility with the current OpenAI integration
   - Maintain TypeScript type safety throughout

2. **State Management:**

   - Design proper state interfaces for each agent
   - Implement clean transitions between agents in the graph
   - Support serialization and deserialization of agent state

3. **Error Handling:**

   - Implement robust error recovery mechanisms
   - Support retries and fallbacks where appropriate
   - Properly log and track errors for debugging

4. **Performance:**

   - Maintain or improve response times compared to the current implementation
   - Optimize LLM calls to reduce costs
   - Support streaming of intermediate results where appropriate

5. **Observability:**

   - Enable tracing of agent workflows
   - Support visualization of agent graphs
   - Facilitate debugging of agent decisions

6. **Testing:**
   - Create unit tests for individual agent nodes
   - Implement integration tests for the entire agent graph
   - Support simulated environments for testing

## Success Metrics

1. **Code Reduction:** 30% reduction in custom agent coordination code
2. **Error Reduction:** 50% reduction in agent coordination errors
3. **Maintainability:** Improved readability and modularity as measured by code reviews
4. **Response Time:** Equal or better response times compared to current implementation
5. **Feature Completeness:** All existing features working with the new implementation
6. **Development Speed:** Faster implementation of new agents or features after migration

## Timeline

- Phase 1 (2 weeks): Research, planning, and proof of concept
- Phase 2 (3 weeks): Implementation of core graph structure and base agents
- Phase 3 (3 weeks): Migration of all existing agents to the new framework
- Phase 4 (2 weeks): Testing, debugging, and optimization

| --------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Learning curve for new frameworks       | Medium | High       | Allocate time for team training and documentation    |
| Compatibility issues with existing code | High   | Medium     | Create isolated implementation with clear interfaces |
| Performance degradation                 | High   | Low        | Benchmark early and optimize                         |
| Missing features in LangGraph.js        | High   | Medium     | Create fallback implementations where needed         |
| Regression in agent capabilities        | High   | Medium     | Develop comprehensive tests before migration         |

## Dependencies

- LangChain.js library
- LangGraph.js library
- Compatible OpenAI API integration
- Access to LangSmith for debugging (optional)

## Future Considerations

- Integration with LangSmith for improved observability
- Adoption of more advanced LangChain patterns as they become available
- Creation of reusable agent components for future projects
- Implementation of more sophisticated memory retrieval systems
